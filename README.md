# 🔐 Simple Encryption & Decryption

A C++ console application implementing four classic encryption algorithms: **Caesar**, **XOR**, **Vigenère**, and **Atbash**. The program provides both encryption and decryption options through a clean terminal interface using inline inputs (entered step-by-step during runtime).

## 📂 Overview

This program allows you to:
- Choose between **encryption** and **decryption**
- Select one of four ciphers
- Enter your message and key inline
- Receive the result instantly

## 🔧 Supported Ciphers

1. **Caesar Cipher**  
   Shifts letters in the alphabet by a given key.

2. **XOR Cipher**  
   Encrypts using the XOR bitwise operation with a key.

3. **Vigenère Cipher**  
   Encrypts by shifting letters using a keyword.

4. **Atbash Cipher**  
   Substitutes each letter with its reverse alphabet counterpart.
